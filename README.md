# ML-Library-1
This Repository contains my project on ML. In this project I have implemented many Machine Learning algorithms from scratch in python. The list of **algorithms** include:
>
*1) Linear Regression*
>
*2) Logistic Regression*
>
*3) K-Nearest Neighbours*
>
*4) K-Means Clustering*
>
*5) Neural Network (Deep)*
>
*6) Decision Tree*
>
Some of the **features** implemented are:-
>
*1) Gradient Descent*
>
*2) Mini-Batch Gradient Descent*
>
*3) Learning Curves... etc.*
