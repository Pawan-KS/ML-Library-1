# ML-Library-1
This Repository contains my project on ML. In this project I have implemented many Machine Learning algorithms from scratch in python. The list of **algorithms** include:
>
*1) Linear Regression*
>
*2) Logistic Regression*
>
*3) K-Nearest Neighbours*
>
*4) K-Means Clustering*
>
*5) Neural Network (Deep)*
>
*6) Decision Tree*
>
with many other Visualisation graphs and comparison of scores with SCIKIT learn.<br>
This project was part of an official competition hosted by [Cyber Labs](https://cyberlabs.club/) (official programming club of the IIT (ISM) Dhanbad) namely 
**WINTER OF CODE (WOC)**
Alse, I won the competition.
